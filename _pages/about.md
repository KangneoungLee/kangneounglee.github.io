Hello, I'm Kangneoung Lee.
I'm a Ph.D student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.

My research interests are
- Vision-based path planning : Ground classification using neural net for semantic segmentation, grid/sample-based path planning
- Object detection : Deep learning, Classification with interpretable model
- Task allocation for multi-agent system

I am advised by [Dr. Kiju Lee](https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/profiles/lee-kiju.html).
I'm currently a member of [Adaptive Robotics and Technology Lab](https://art.engr.tamu.edu/).
